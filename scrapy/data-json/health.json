Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''\u00a2 Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''\u00a2 Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''\u00a2 Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''\u00a2 Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''\u00a2 Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation."},

N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.Data collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.The data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.The N-SSATS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration."},

Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.The questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).Survey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.The NSDUH is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration."},

While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.The TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables.The TEDS data collection effort began in 1989 with three-year development grants to states. Within each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding, including the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant monies, are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment, regardless of the source of funding for individual clients.TEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration."},

Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas.DAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. The dataset includes demographics, up to 16 drugs involved in the ED visit, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following the visit."},

Users can select, sort, export and view the data either by spreadsheet or preformatted reports; - Maps - visually explore the HRSA-specific information, health resources and demographic data in geographic relation to one another; - Map Data Services - utilize data from the HDW to create custom maps and incorporate your own data; and - Downloads - ability to download data on Health Professional Shortage Areas, Primary Care Service Areas, and National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses. The HDW data content and functionality are continually evolving so a What's New page is made available. The data is refreshed continually and most data are updated on a daily basis. Please see the Data Refresh Dates section of the website for more information. The HDW is designed to provide extensive tabular and spatial information available on HRSA-supported programs and related health resources. To do this, the warehouse combines data from various federal sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and various HRSA programs. For more information about where the data in the data warehouse comes from, see the Data Sources section of the website."},

In FFY 2000, 6.3 million children ages 1 to 20 were reported to receive some form of dental care (either preventive or treatment) the number more than doubled to 15.4 million by FFY 2010. Part of the increase was because the overall number of children covered by Medicaid rose by 12 million (50 percent), but the percentage of children who received dental care climbed appreciably from 29.3. percent in FFY 2000 to 46.4 percent in FFY 2010.In that same time period, the number of children ages 1 to 20 receiving preventive dental services climbed from a reported 5.0 million to 13.6 million, while the percentage of children receiving preventive dental services rose from 23.2 to 40.8 percent. For children ages 1 to 20 who received dental treatment services, the reported number rose from 3.3 million in FFY 2000 to 7.6 million in FFY 2010. The percentage of children who obtained dental treatment services increased from 15.3 to 22.9 percent. In FFY 2010, about one sixth of children covered by Medicaid (15.7 percent) ages 6-14 had a dental sealant placed on a permanent molar.While most states have made steady progress in improving childrens access to dental care in Medicaid over the past decade, there is still substantial variation across states and more remains to be done."},

Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition, these conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes, are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care. Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1."},

This issue brief summarizes the availability, completeness, quality, and usability of the encounter data in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) File, derived from MSIS, for enrollees in comprehensive managed care plans. It also gives specific information by state. The results should be encouraging for researchers and policymakers. Most states that have comprehensive managed care plans reported data to the other services (OT), inpatient (IP), and prescription drug (RX) files in 2008. Of those data, the majority are usable."},

While relatively few adults in Idaho received a wellness exam after such coverage was added, the adoption of managed care for dental services was associated with increased receipt of dental care, including preventive care. New limits on brand name prescriptions in Kentucky were associated with a reduction in the proportion of enrollees with two or more monthly name brand prescriptions, but small copayments introduced did not appear to have a dramatic impact. Thus, changes in financial incentives on both the supply side (such as reimbursement increases) and the demand side (i.e., benefit changes) alone may not be enough to generate the desired levels of preventive care, especially among those with chronic health conditions."},

The study focuses on the personal health care (PHC) sector, which includes the goods and services rendered to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition in an individual. The official 2007 NHEA estimate for PHC spending is 1,915 billion dollars and the MEPS estimate is 1,126 billion dollars. Adjusting the NHEA estimates for differences in underlying populations, covered services, and other measurement concepts reduces the NHEA estimate for 2007 to 1,366 billion dollars. As a result, MEPS is 240 billion dollars, or 17.6 percent less than the adjusted NHEA total. The reconciliation provides a consistent baseline of health expenditure data for policy simulations, enabling researchers to adjust MEPS to be consistent with the NHEA so that the projected costs, as well as budgetary and tax implications of any policy change are consistent with national health spending estimates."},

In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements."},

Most moves (72.2 percent) were not associated with enrollment gaps, and 8.2 percent of moves were associated with gaps of fewer than three months. Enrollment gaps may indicate a lack of health insurance coverage, resulting in a lack of continuity of care and a risk to patient health outcomes, an increased use of higher cost emergency services, and higher system-wide health care costs.

Costs were almost 6,000 dollars higher for those who accessed peer support services, mostly for professional services and prescription drugs. While the use of Medicaid peer support may not result in savings from fewer costly crisis stabilizations and psychiatric hospitalizations, it does support the principles of self-direction and recovery. State policy makers must weigh the potential higher cost of peer support programs with efforts to change the delivery of mental health services."},

Using Cost Reports and the Home Health Compare (HHC) quality report card 2010 data, they estimated the relationships between total costs, the type of patients served by the agency, its quality of care, and its market environment. They found that while non-profits are much larger than for-profit agencies and have lower costs per patient, they have higher costs per visit. Both types of agencies show diseconomies of scale, suggesting that efficiencies could be achieved if the industry operated smaller scale agencies, increased the salaried nursing staff while it decreased the number of contract nurses, and emphasized patient assessment services. Despite its limitations, this study offers new insights into home-care agencies costs in the Prospective Payment System and HHC era."},

The study followed 34,400 enrollees in the Alabama Childrens Health Insurance Program, ALL Kids, whose copayment increased in fiscal year 2004, and compared their patterns of prescription drug spending before and after the increase. The percent of children with any expense for prescription drugs decreased by 5.8 percent. Among those with prescription fills, expenses decreased by 7.9 percent. The largest decline was for antihistamine drugs, the smallest for central nervous system agents, which include antidepressants. Children with chronic conditions were less responsive to the copayment increase. There was no evidence of concurrent increases in other medical expenditures, which might have been due to less prescription drug utilization. This suggests that increasing copayments may help control Program costs."},

Age, race, education, and self-reported health status are associated with greater awareness of physician quality information (PQI), as are trust in the Internet as a source of health care information and not trusting ones physician as an information source. Population trends over time will not likely improve awareness, nor will increases in patient activation or satisfaction with care-both goals of recent Medicare initiatives.

This study elaborates on differences in estimates and how MCBS sampling and data processing dictate the need for special weights. Alternative weighting schemes were compared using estimates from different approaches and with CMS administrative data counts where applicable. Since the differences observed were generally modest, it was concluded on the basis of other factors (such as ease of use, operational simplicity, and methodological soundness) that weights using Ratio Raking adjustments provide a reasonable alternative to traditional ATC survey weights."},

This study draws on information from a previous study of the maternal and infant outcomes of birth center care to determine whether such care reduces Medicaid costs for low income women. Costs to Medicaid are derived from birth center data and from other national sources of the cost of obstetrical care. The authors estimate that birth center care could save an average of 1,164 dollars per birth (2008 constant dollars), or 11.6 million dollars per 10,000 births per year.

Researchers selected four states to conduct an in-depth review of their reporting systems and uses of the data California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Pennsylvania and found that all four have innovative approaches in using these data to promote patient safety initiatives and publicly report facility-level rates. State selections of adverse events to report were at least partially influenced by Medicares list of hospital acquired conditions (HACs) for nonpayment. Federal initiatives have bolstered HAC reporting activity at the state level, yet there is still wide variability and lack of standardization. The authors recommend that more work and research is needed to develop a national reporting system template that has standard definitions, methodology, and reporting."},

The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.\n   NHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.\n   The NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).\n   While the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information."},

BOS is estimated to be present in more than 50 percent of lung allograft recipients at five years after transplantation, and remains a major obstacle to long-term lung transplant survival. One of the requirements of a CED research study protocol is that it should discuss how the results are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population, to allow statistical inferences about whether Medicare patients may benefit from the intervention. The download on this page provides a table of the incidence of lung transplants in the Medicare population in recent years to aid researchers who develop CED studies of ECP for BOS in determining sample size estimates."},

The data sets are summarized by meaningful Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Current Procedural Terminology, HCPC CPT, code ranges. Brief descriptions for the code ranges and modifiers are provided in the readme file. The data set name contains the year followed by a five character sequence that is the HCPC CPT code. This HCPC CPT code corresponds to the first HCPC CPT in the selected code range of disciplines. Within each code range are, procedural, condition, or description subheadings. Each data set displays the allowed services, allowed charges, and payment amounts by HCPC CPT codes and prominent modifiers. These reports will only illustrate the modifiers where duplicative claim submissions occur. This is to avoid duplicate counting of services. Utilization for modifiers not affected by duplicative counting are collapsed into the Other category on the reports. Therefore, not all Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published modifiers are illustrated. The file is updated annually and usually available by September for the previous year."}]
