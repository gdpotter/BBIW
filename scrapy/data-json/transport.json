To qualify for inclusion, a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling a traffic-way customarily open to the public and resulting in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-motorist) within 30 days of the crash.  Each crash has more than 100 coded data elements that characterize the crash, the vehicles, and the people involved.  The specific data elements may be changed slightly each year to conform to the changing user needs, vehicle characteristics and highway safety emphasis areas.  The type of information that FARS, a major application, processes is therefore motor vehicle crash data."},

GradeDEC.Net is a web-based tool for the investment analysis of highway-rail grade crossing improvements.  It provides state departments of transportation, local governments, metropolitan planning agencies, inspectors, and railroad companies with the online ability to conduct benefit-cost analysis of highway-rail grade crossing infrastructure investments. GradeDEC.Net allows users to divert highway traffic to and from closed or separated grade crossings to adjacent crossings, and calculate a full set of benefits including changes in accident risk associated with changes in traditional grade crossing technology. Users can also evaluate supplemental safety measures listed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking covering the use of locomotive horns at highway-rail grade crossing. Users are also able to save an analysis on-site for later revision and update and submit reports directly to the FRA."},
